    <div>Pretentious Indie Band was founded in 2010 by <a href="http://about.me/loupaniccia" target="_blank">Lou Paniccia</a>, a longtime
      member of the team behind Sonicbids and drummer for several indie rock
      bands. Lou realized there had to be a middle ground for bands looking to
      make it that was somewhere between signing away 15% to a manager who would
      handle everything and simply going it alone, 1 band vs. the world.</div>

      <b>Indie artists don't need to be isolationist.</b>

    <div>What if several successful independent bands joined forces to create their
      own management company? They could pool resources, experience, contacts
      and get the benefits of being part of a larger organization while still
      keeping their independence as artists.</div>
    <div>
      <br> 
    </div>
    <div>Today, PiB Management represents a cooperative roster of artists making
      waves in their respective markets, driven by a central support team as
      well as their own manpower. Who says indie bands have to go it alone?</div>
